# Visualizing-Mass-Spectrometry-Data-Program
Visualizing Mass Spectrometry Data with a 3D Bar Chart and  Plotting Intensity and Retention Time of Mass Spectrometry Peaks with a 2D Line Plot in Python
->file of computation biology part one
installs three Python libraries (numpy, pyopenms, and pandas) It then imports several modules from these libraries, as well as from matplotlib, and defines a 3D bar chart
The code reads in a mass spectrometry file in mzML format using the pyopenms library, and then extracts the first 100 peaks from the first spectrum of the file. It stores the m/z values, intensity values, and retention times of these peaks in three lists, and then creates a pandas DataFrame from these lists. The DataFrame is then used to create a 3D bar chart using the matplotlib library, visualizing the relationship between m/z, intensity, and retention time of the extracted peaks. The resulting chart is displayed using a matplotlib interactive backend.
-> part two file
defines a 2D plot for visualizing mass spectrometry data.

The code reads in a mass spectrometry file in mzML format using the pyopenms library, and then extracts the intensity and retention time values of peaks that have m/z values within a specified range. The code then creates a 2D plot using the extracted intensity and retention time values, with retention time on the x-axis and intensity on the y-axis. The resulting plot is displayed using the matplotlib library.

The code is specifically designed to plot the intensity and retention time values of peaks with a constant m/z value range (from MZ_Start to MZ_End), which can be adjusted to visualize different regions of the mass spectrum.
