# Visualizing-Mass-Spectrometry-Data-Program
Visualizing Mass Spectrometry Data with a 3D Bar Chart and  Plotting Intensity and Retention Time of Mass Spectrometry Peaks with a 2D Line Plot in Python
# file of computation biology part one
installs three Python libraries (numpy, pyopenms, and pandas) It then imports several modules from these libraries, as well as from matplotlib, and defines a 3D bar chart
The code reads in a mass spectrometry file in mzML format using the pyopenms library, and then extracts the first 100 peaks from the first spectrum of the file. It stores the m/z values, intensity values, and retention times of these peaks in three lists, and then creates a pandas DataFrame from these lists. The DataFrame is then used to create a 3D bar chart using the matplotlib library, visualizing the relationship between m/z, intensity, and retention time of the extracted peaks. The resulting chart is displayed using a matplotlib interactive backend.
