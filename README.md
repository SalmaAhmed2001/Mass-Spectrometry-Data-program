# Visualizing-Mass-Spectrometry-Data-Program
Visualizing Data with a 3D Bar Chart and  Plotting Intensity and Retention Time of Mass Spectrometry Peaks with a 2D Line Plot in Python.

note : make sure that at first you installed Python libraries (numpy, pyopenms, and pandas) using the pip package manager.

->file of computation biology part one:

 is useful for visualizing mass spectrometry data in a 3D format, allowing for easier interpretation and analysis of the relationships between m/z, intensity, and retention time of the peaks in the data.
 
-> Part two file:

is specifically designed to plot the intensity and retention time values of peaks with a constant m/z value range (from MZ_Start to MZ_End), which can be adjusted to visualize different regions of the mass spectrum. This type of plot can be useful for visualizing the general shape of a mass spectrum and identifying peaks of interest.
